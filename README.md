IMPORT THE testdb IN YOUR localhost/phpmyadmin

IMPORTANT NOTE: create testdb table on your localhost/phpmyadmin, and do not rename the database testdb, because that is the default name.

SECOND IMPORTANT NOTE: create test folder in your htdocs, inside test folder start to clone or pull repository. Do not use other names or rename the test folder because it is the default path of every directories on the system if you rename test folder or use other names the system cannot call the directories.

Here is the default path of the system.
** test folder
    -> admin
    -> shop
    -> .htaccess
    -> README.md
    -> testdb

If you start to clone or pull the repo you got this inside the folder.
** test folder
    -> ecommerce
        -> admin
        -> shop
        -> .htaccess
        -> README.md
        -> testdb

Copy the admin folder, shop folder, .htaccess, README.md, testdb outside of ecommerce. Then you can run the system.

Dashboard Link: localhost/test/admin
Shop Link: localhost/test/shop/home

NOTE: There is no index.php on shop that's why we use home.php.
